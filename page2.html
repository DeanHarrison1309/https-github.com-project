<h1>The Beatles</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        I've been a fan of The Beatles since the age of 7, when I received me my first ever album, "The Beatles 20 Golden Hits" for my birthday (which I still have in my collection).   I really enjoy visiting Matthew Street (where The Cavern used to be), visualising the street in 1961.  Then there'e The Beatles Story a 5 minute walk away, with Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields a short bus ride away.  Call me nostalgic.  Call me anything you want.  The Beatles are still the greatest, never to be surpassed.   I must have listened to the vast majority of their tracks 1000 times over, closer to 5000 times for my favourite tracks.   As long as I can put football to the back of my mind for several hours (easier said than done), it's a nice day out.
