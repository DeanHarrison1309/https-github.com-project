        <p>Data Protection (General Data Protection Regulations): There are many rules and regulations where the collection of personal data is involved.   .  You must have a valid reason as to why you need the information and how you intend to use it, making this very clear to the person in question.  Their information can be used for nothing other than the reason you have specified.    For a full list of all data protection regulations, visit the Information Commissioner's Office website https://ico.org.uk/.
