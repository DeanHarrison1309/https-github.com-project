                <p>
                        A digital project comprises the planning, preparation, and production that goes into creating electronic publications. Possible electronic publications include: Web sites, electronic books, digital images, etc. (https://cdrh.unl.edu/articles/basicguide/digitalproject)
                        Letâ€™s focus on a website.
                        Planning: First of all, let us decided on a theme for the website.   What is it about?  What should it contain?  What is the goal/purpose of this site?   What age bracket/audience is it aimed at?   What will attract this audience to the site?  How can the site differ to and improve upon currently existing sites of a similar theme?
                        Preparation:  Let us now do some research.   We need to gather as much information as we can about the topic.   Collect as many relevant facts and figures as possible.   Find at least 5 websites similar to that which we have in mind and compare these sites.  What elements are common to each site?  Look for something unique about a site.    
                        Production: Production of our website will begin with building the structure (HTML).  Think about how we want the site to look like?  How many pages do we want?  How much information per page?  What should be on the homepage?  The structure complete, we can then incorporate our Javascript and finally decorate the site using CSS.

                <h3>1.4 Risks which might Impact Digital Projects and the causes thereof.</h3> 
                
                <p>
                There are a number of risks to be taken into consideration with digital projects.
                1. Electronic threats such as hacking or a virus.
                Data and other information is very often confidential.    Access to this data by third parties may be extremely detrimental to a business.    
                2. Technical problems, such as crashing, or hard drive problems.
                Storage of data by means of IT has huge benefits (as mentioned in 1.1), but at the same time, these records are vulnerable and may be lost if technical problems arise.   
                3. Human error
                Another risk is that of human error.  Data may be entered incorrectly or deleted by accident. Computer files and records are only as reliable and accurate as the person who enters the data.
