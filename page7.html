<h3>2.1. Ongoing use of IT tools</h3>
<p> Prior to starting this couse, I was unfamiliar with Visual Studio Code, Trello and Github.  Broadening my scope with this new software has been hugely beneficial.  The websites I've created in the past have been simple drag and drop projects. Future developmnts will be much more advanced. </p>

        <h3>2.2.Were Tools Approporiate</h3>
<p> I have thoroughly enjoyed learning how to use Visual Studio Code.  The project in question has been rather difficult due to a lack of exprience, but given time I'm confident that I will be able to develop impressive websites usingh Visual Studio Code.  The Trello and Github services were very useful and I will use them to my benefit in all future projects.  Microsoft Office Picture Manager and Paint were both appropriate for the project</p>
