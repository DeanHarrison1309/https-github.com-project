        <h3>1.1 IT in Modern Business</h3>
         <p>IT plays a major role in modern business, vastly increasing the speed and efficiency of a business. Data storage and Information management are vital cogs in the running of a business.  The difference in terms of efficiency between storing data on computers, which can be accessed in a matter of seconds compared to retrieving paper documents kept in filing cabinets (not to mention the floor space saved), is astronomic.
                Information management (stock maintenance, sales information, customer relationships) are much easier to keep track of through IT.   Keeping such data organised will help to improve the productivity of a business, thus increasing profits.
                Communication with customers is another area where time and speed of delivery via IT bears no comparison to traditional methods.
        
        <h3>1.2 Methods, Skills and Resources needed to complete digital projects.</h3>
        
                <p>There are 3 essential resources that you need in order to develop a nice website.
                Javascript: Javascript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code.
                HTML: Hypertext markup language (HTML) is the major markup language used to display Web pages on the Internet. In other words, Web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images or other resources through a Web browser.
                CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a standard (or language) that describes the formatting of markup language pages. CSS enables developers to separate content and visual elements for greater page control and flexibility. A CSS file is normally attached to an HTML file by means of a link in the HTML file.  
                (techopedia.com/dictionary)
                In simple terms, HTML is the structure for your website, Javascript contains and adds information to the site, and CSS is used to style your website.  Ample skills in all 3 are necessary to create a website which is pleasing to the eye.
