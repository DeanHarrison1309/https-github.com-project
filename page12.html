<h3>1.1. Content Layout</h3>

<p>Every html page on my website comprises of a 'head" (the page heading), "body" (the content of the page), "div" (divisions on the page), paragrapohs (p) and page breaks (br). The Home Page of the site tells you a little 'About Myself'.  A link at the bottom of the Home Page takes you to a second 'About Myself' page, expanding  on personal details and interests.  The same applies to this new page, a link at the bottom taking you to a third page of personal information.

    <br>Every page on my site consists of Unit links across the top of the page.  Selecting one of these links takes you to the chosen Unit's home page.   On this Unit's home page are several more links taking you to each individual sector of the unit.
    
    The background of each page has been based on personal interests.   As happy as I am with this theme, the choice of background pictures needs improving upon.     Reading the text is not easy.</p>
