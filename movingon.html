<h1>South Korea</h1>
        <p>
        Moving on, after teaching Secondary Maths in Manchester for 5 years (1996 to 2001), I decided to move to South Korea to teach English as a second language. The main reason behind this move was to watch the FIFA World Cup, 2002. My plan was to teach there for 1 year and then return to England, but after 12 months, I simply couldn’t leave. Life in South Korea as an English teacher was too good to walk away from. The people, the weather, the scenery, the students, the cost of living, the beaches. I could go on.
        I married my Korean wife in 2012. When we became parents in 2014, we decided to move to England. I started teaching secondary maths again, but soon decided that it was time for a career change.
        I have designed quite a few websites using drag and drop sites such as weebly.com (Example: http://sep1234.weebly.com  (a site for my students when teaching in Korea)).     I enjoyed designing these sites, and I believe that this is the way forward for me, hence my decision to enrol on this coding course.
