<h3>2.5. Final Outcome</h3>
<p>To summarise, I am rather disappointed with my finished site.  The tools were not to blame.  Visual Studio Code, Trello and Github were perfect for the project at hand, but a lack of knowledghe and experience is most apparant in the final outcome.  Even so, all requirements of the assignment have been completed, and as a first attempt, I feel that the result is acceptable.  The outcome of whatever project lies ahead will certinly be better than this.</p>
