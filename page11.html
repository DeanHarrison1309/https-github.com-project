<h3>3.3. Solutions to Improve Own Productivity</h3>
<p> Teamwork is a key aspect of efficiency.    If several individuals are given exactly the same project, the tasks laid before them should be distributed evenly.    If, for example,  there are several areas to be researched, one person can research one area on behalf of the group.     This will save an immense amount of time, the group collaborating  to complete the project in a fraction of the time it would have taken them single-handedly, working as individuals.        'Slack' would be an excellent tool for such groupwork.</p>
        <h3>3.4. Testing Digital Solutions</h3>
<p>The testing of digital solutions can involve accessibility, usability, performance, security and many more tests.

    One means of testing is the "waterfall model".   This is carried out to ensure that a flow of commands run smoothly and according to plan.
    
    <br>"The waterfall model: a sequence of stages in which the output of each stage becomes the input for the next. These stages can be characterized and divided up in different ways, including the following:

Requirement Specification
Design
Construction (AKA Implementation or Coding)
Integration
Testing (AKA Validation)
Installation
Maintenance"
