<h3>3.1. Benefits and Drawbacks of Tools </h3>
<p>As I gradually familiarised myself with the selected tools, procedures and processes became clearer.  One thing which I continually struggled with, however, with errors appearing on the screen continually was saving my work to Github.   Github itself is a wonderful means of accessing work, but adding your work to the site could be much more straight forward.   I don't understand why work can not simply be dragged to, or copied and pasted to Github.   Trello was to be a very useful tool in improving efficiency, simple to use, providing a clear image of project status, helping to prioritise tasks.  </p>
        <h3>3.2. How to improve efficiency</h3>
<p>As mentioned, saving work to Github proved to be an annoying stumbling block for me personally.  The biggest lesson I have learned from this project is to give pages much more appropriate and descriptive names,  Doing so will certainly improve my speed and efficiency.   Another means of improving efficiency would have been teamwork.   Designating one field of research to each member of the class would have been a huge time saver. </p>
