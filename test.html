    <h3>1.0 About Me</h3>
<body>
<p>
        My name is Dean Harrison and I’m from Bury, Lancashire.  I graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University in 1996 as a Bachelor of Education, specialised in Secondary Mathematics.
        My interests include football, golf , ornithology and aircraft.   Of these interests, football leads the way.   Very passionate about the beautiful game, I'm an avid fan of Manchester United, holding a season ticket from 1987 to 2002.   
        Being a devout Manchester United supporter, you'd probably guess that the last place on my list of places to visit in the UK would be Liverpool.   Au contraire…..
        I've been a fan of The Beatles since 1977, when my grandmother bought me my first ever album, "The Beatles 20 Golden Hits" for my 7th birthday (which I still have in my collection).   I love visiting Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields, Albert Dock, and especially Matthew Street (where The Cavern used to be), visualising the street in 1961.   Call me nostalgic.  Call me anything you want.  The Beatles are still the greatest, never to be surpassed.   I must have listened to a vast number of their tracks 5000 times over, and counting.
        Moving on, after teaching Secondary Maths in Manchester for 5 years (1996 to 2001), I decided to move to South Korea to teach English as a second language. The main reason behind this move was to watch the FIFA World Cup, 2002. My plan was to teach there for 1 year and then return to England, but after 12 months, I simply couldn’t leave. Life in South Korea as an English teacher was too good to walk away from. The people, the weather, the scenery, the students, the cost of living, the beaches. I could go on.
        I married my Korean wife in 2012. When we became parents in 2014, we decided to move to England. I started teaching secondary maths again, but soon decided that it was time for a career change.
        I have designed quite a few websites using drag and drop sites such as weebly.com (Example: http://sep1234.weebly.com  (a site for my students when teaching in Korea)).     I enjoyed designing these sites, and I believe that this is the way forward for me, hence my decision to enrol on this coding course.

<h3>1.1 IT in Modern Business</h3>
</p>
        IT plays a major role in modern business, vastly increasing the speed and efficiency of a business. Data storage and Information management are vital cogs in the running of a business.  The difference in terms of efficiency between storing data on computers, which can be accessed in a matter of seconds compared to retrieving paper documents kept in filing cabinets (not to mention the floor space saved), is astronomic.
        Information management (stock maintenance, sales information, customer relationships) are much easier to keep track of through IT.   Keeping such data organised will help to improve the productivity of a business, thus increasing profits.
        Communication with customers is another area where time and speed of delivery via IT bears no comparison to traditional methods.

<h3>1.2 Methods, Skills and Resources needed to complete digital projects.</h3>
</p>
        There are 3 essential resources that you need in order to develop a nice website.
        Javascript: Javascript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code.
        HTML: Hypertext markup language (HTML) is the major markup language used to display Web pages on the Internet. In other words, Web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images or other resources through a Web browser.
        CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a standard (or language) that describes the formatting of markup language pages. CSS enables developers to separate content and visual elements for greater page control and flexibility. A CSS file is normally attached to an HTML file by means of a link in the HTML file.  
        (techopedia.com/dictionary)
        In simple terms, HTML is the structure for your website, Javascript contains and adds information to the site, and CSS is used to style your website.  Ample skills in all 3 are necessary to create a website which is pleasing to the eye.

<h3>1.3 Plan and Carry Out Tasks using IT</h3>
</p>
        A digital project comprises the planning, preparation, and production that goes into creating electronic publications. Possible electronic publications include: Web sites, electronic books, digital images, etc. (https://cdrh.unl.edu/articles/basicguide/digitalproject)
        Let’s focus on a website.
        Planning: First of all, let us decided on a theme for the website.   What is it about?  What should it contain?  What is the goal/purpose of this site?   What age bracket/audience is it aimed at?   What will attract this audience to the site?  How can the site differ to and improve upon currently existing sites of a similar theme?
        Preparation:  Let us now do some research.   We need to gather as much information as we can about the topic.   Collect as many relevant facts and figures as possible.   Find at least 5 websites similar to that which we have in mind and compare these sites.  What elements are common to each site?  Look for something unique about a site.    
        Production: Production of our website will begin with building the structure (HTML).  Think about how we want the site to look like?  How many pages do we want?  How much information per page?  What should be on the homepage?  The structure complete, we can then incorporate our Javascript and finally decorate the site using CSS.</p>
