<h3>1.5. Selecting and using Systems and Software</h3>
<p> I believe that the software I chose was very suitable for my project.   Visual Studio Code, Trello and Github combined made the project straight forward. As I familiarise myself with this software, planning will become even easier, improving my efficiency of project developmemnts.    I would highly recommend each of these.   
        Paint and Microsoft Office Picture Manager were also used to create backgrounds, both of which I am very experienced with.
        </p>
        <h3>1.6.Trello and GitHub</h3>
            <p>
        Trello has helped in the organisation and planning of my project, enabling me to keep track of tasks, clearing them on a steady basis, whilst GitHub enables me to access my codes from anywhere, eliminating the need for storage or having to email files to myself.   Both services have proved to be very useful in the development of my project.
