<h3>1.6. Access Issues</h3>
<p>Your website should be accessible to everybody equally.   There are strict requirements to meet this condition.

    <br>
    "Meeting government accessibility requirements:<br>
    To meet government accessibility requirements, digital services must:
    
    ·        meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) as a minimum.
    
    ·        work on the most commonly used assistive technologies - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools.
    
    ·        include people with disabilities in user research.
    
    ·        have an accompanying accessibility page that explains how accessible the service is - the date you need to publish this depends on the date the service moves into public beta.

    <br>
    What type of disabilities could hinder access to your site?    The first that spring to mind are visual impairment, hearing difficulties and physical disabilities.    There are also neurological disabilities, such as epilepsy, which can be triggered by flashing lights.  Dyslexia is another disability which can hinder access.
    
    You should think about all of these things from the word go, to avoid having to go back and make amendments.
    
    A good way to see if your website is indeed accessible to people with disabilities would be to let a group of people with a range of disabilities try to use the site.
    
     
    
    <br>"The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops technical specifications, guidelines, techniques, and supporting resources that describe accessibility solutions. These are considered international standards for web accessibility; for example, WCAG 2.0 is also an ISO standard: ISO/IEC 40500". https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/

        <h3>1.7.Appropriate Filetypes for Websites</h3>
<p>Filetypes for website images include TIFF, BMP, JEPG and GIF.
<br>"TIFF or Tagged Image File Format are lossless images files meaning that they do not need to compress or lose any image quality or information (although there are options for compression), allowing for very high-quality images but also larger file sizes.
<br>BMP or Bitmap Image File is a format developed by Microsoft for Windows. There is no compression or information loss with BMP files which allow images to have very high quality, but also very large file sizes.
<br>JPEG, which stands for Joint Photographic Experts Groups is a “lossy” format meaning that the image is compressed to make a smaller file. The compression does create a loss in quality but this loss is generally not noticeable. 
<br>GIF or Graphics Interchange Format files are widely used for web graphics, because they are limited to only 256 colors, can allow for transparency, and can be animated. GIF files are typically small is size and are very portable".

<br> The most common of these is JPEG, which is used to store digital camera images and other types of photograpic images.
