<h3>2.3. Website Review</h3>
<p> My website is now complete, but I am not very happy with it.  Given more time it would be much, much more impressive.  The pictures selected are not ideal, the background merging with similar coloured text, making it hard to read.   I have learned by my errors, especially the fact that pages should be given descriptive names rather than labelled as Page 1, Page 2 etc.  This can make things very confusing when it comes to linking pages.  </p>
    <h3>2.4. Improvements</h3>
<p>My website could be improved upon in many ways.   Links between pages are a little confusing.  Text is hard to read in places due to the choice of text colour and the picture in the background.  I think a moving picture would make it easier to read the text, the colour in the background changing continually, meaning that there will be a definite contrast between background and text at some point.  A different picture for every page would be better. Website references are not clear.   The use of italics and a different text colour for the quotes is necessary. Music in the background would make a difference.  Given more time, I could certainly improve my site.</p>
